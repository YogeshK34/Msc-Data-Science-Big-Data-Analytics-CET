## Answer Key:

1. **D) 224**

1. The pattern is: 3, 3+7=10, 10+19=29, 29+37=66, 66+61=127, 127+97=224
2. The differences increase by: 7, 19, 37, 61, 97 (adding 12, 18, 24, 36)



2. **B) 50**

1. The pattern is: 2, 2+3=5, 5+5=10, 10+7=17, 17+9=26, 26+11=37, 37+13=50
2. Each time we add an odd number that increases by 2



3. **B) DW**

1. The pattern is: A→B→C→D→E and Z→Y→X→W→V
2. First letter moves forward, second letter moves backward



4. **B) NM**

1. The pattern is: Z→W→T→Q→N (decreasing by 3, 3, 3, 3)
2. And A→D→G→J→M (increasing by 3, 3, 3, 3)



5. **B) Daughter**

1. "Only son of my father's wife" refers to Rajesh himself
2. So the girl is Rajesh's daughter



6. **A) Sister-in-law**

1. A is C's father
2. D is B's son
3. C is D's sister
4. So B must be C's mother and A's wife
5. E is A's brother, so B is E's sister-in-law



7. **A) 30 meters West**

1. Rahul walks 20m North, 30m West, 20m South
2. The North and South movements cancel out
3. He ends up 30m West of starting point



8. **A) 4 km**

1. Priya walks 5km East, 3km South, 9km West, 3km North
2. East-West: 5km East - 9km West = 4km West
3. North-South: 3km South - 3km North = 0km
4. Distance = 4km



9. **A) All books are paper**

1. All books are pages, and all pages are paper
2. Therefore, all books are paper



10. **B) Some living beings are cats**

1. Some cats are animals, and all animals are living beings
2. Therefore, some living beings are cats



11. **B) Wednesday**

1. 2025 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days
2. 365 ÷ 7 = 52 weeks + 1 day
3. So Dec 31 will be the same day as Jan 1, which is Wednesday



12. **A) Wednesday**

1. March 1 is Tuesday
2. March (31) + April (30) + May (31) + June (30) + July (31) + August (31) + September (30) + October (31) + November (30) = 275 days
3. 275 ÷ 7 = 39 weeks + 2 days
4. So Nov 30 is 2 days after Tuesday, which is Thursday
5. Therefore, Nov 30 is Thursday, and the last day of November is Thursday



13. **A) 3:15**

1. At 3:00, the hour hand is at 3 and the minute hand is at 12
2. The hour hand moves 30° per hour or 0.5° per minute
3. The minute hand moves 6° per minute
4. For a right angle (90°), we need the hands to be 90° apart
5. At 3:15, the hour hand has moved 7.5° (0.5° × 15) from the 3 position
6. The minute hand has moved 90° (6° × 15) from the 12 position
7. The angle between them is 90° - 7.5° = 82.5°, which is not exactly 90°
8. The correct time for a 90° angle is approximately 3:16.4



14. **B) 22**

1. In a 12-hour period, the hands overlap 11 times
2. In a 24-hour period, this happens twice, so 11 × 2 = 22 times



15. **A) QSJOUFQ**

1. Each letter is replaced by the previous letter in the alphabet
2. C→R, O→F, M→U, etc.
3. For PRINTER: P→Q, R→S, I→J, N→O, T→U, E→F, R→S
4. So PRINTER becomes QSJOUFQ



16. **B) R**

1. P is at one extreme end
2. S is to the immediate right of Q
3. T is to the immediate left of R
4. The only valid arrangement is: P, T, R, Q, S
5. So R is in the middle



17. **A) F, D, A, B, C, E**

1. F is to the left of D
2. D is to the left of A
3. A is to the left of B
4. C is to the right of D
5. E is to the right of C
6. The only valid arrangement is: F, D, A, B, C, E



18. **A) 2**

1. '256' means 'red sweet apple'
2. '589' means 'apple and orange'
3. '234' means 'sweet and sour'
4. Comparing '256' and '234', the common digit is 2, which must represent 'sweet'



19. **B) 14th**

1. Originally, Rahul was at position X from the left
2. After shifting 4 places right, he became 12th from left
3. So X + 4 = 12, which means X = 8
4. In a row of 21 boys, if he's 8th from left, he's (21 - 8 + 1) = 14th from right



20. **A) A**

1. B is not at the extreme end
2. C is between A and B
3. So the arrangement must be: A, C, B, ...
4. D is to the right of B
5. E is to the right of A
6. The only valid arrangement is: A, C, B, D, E
7. So A is at the extreme left end
