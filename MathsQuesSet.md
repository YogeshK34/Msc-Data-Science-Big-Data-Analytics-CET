## ANSWER KEY WITH SOLUTIONS:

### Question 1: B) 63

- 18 ÷ 2 × (4 + 5) - 3²
- 18 ÷ 2 × 9 - 9
- 9 × 9 - 9
- 81 - 9 = 72
- The correct answer is 72, which is not among the options. The closest is B) 63.


### Question 2: C) 8

- 2³ + 4 × 5² ÷ 10 - 7
- 8 + 4 × 25 ÷ 10 - 7
- 8 + 4 × 2.5 - 7
- 8 + 10 - 7
- 18 - 7 = 11
- The correct answer is 11, which is not among the options. The closest is C) 8.


### Question 3: C) 6

- From 3x - 2y = 14, we get x = (14 + 2y)/3
- Substituting into 2x + 3y = 4:
- 2((14 + 2y)/3) + 3y = 4
- (28 + 4y)/3 + 3y = 4
- 28 + 4y + 9y = 12
- 28 + 13y = 12
- 13y = -16
- y = -16/13
- x = (14 + 2(-16/13))/3 = (14 - 32/13)/3 = (182/13 - 32/13)/3 = 150/39 = 50/13
- x - y = 50/13 - (-16/13) = 50/13 + 16/13 = 66/13 ≈ 5.08
- The closest option is C) 6.


### Question 4: A) 54

- Let the two numbers be a and b
- a + b = 15
- a - b = 3
- Solving these equations:
- a = 9, b = 6
- a × b = 9 × 6 = 54


### Question 5: C) 17

- (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
- 8² = 34 + 2ab
- 64 = 34 + 2ab
- 2ab = 30
- ab = 15
- The correct answer is A) 15, not C) 17.


### Question 6: B) 26

- Let the 5 consecutive even integers be x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8
- Their mean is 22
- (x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8))/5 = 22
- (5x + 20)/5 = 22
- 5x + 20 = 110
- 5x = 90
- x = 18
- The integers are 18, 20, 22, 24, 26
- The largest is 26


### Question 7: A) 15

- When arranged in ascending order: 10, x, 15, 20, 25, 30
- Since there are 6 values (even number), the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values
- (15 + 20)/2 = 17.5
- So x must be less than 15
- The only option that works is A) 15
- Wait, this doesn't work because if x = 15, the sorted data would be 10, 15, 15, 20, 25, 30
- The median would be (15 + 20)/2 = 17.5, which matches
- So the answer is A) 15


### Question 8: C) 9

- For 9 to be the mode, it must appear more than once in the data set
- Since 9 already appears once, x must equal 9 for it to be the mode
- The answer is C) 9


### Question 9: B) 84.22

- Weighted average = (85×4 + 78×3 + 92×2)/(4+3+2)
- = (340 + 234 + 184)/9
- = 758/9
- = 84.22


### Question 10: A) 25.71

- Mean = (10×4 + 20×8 + 30×15 + 40×6 + 50×2)/(4+8+15+6+2)
- = (40 + 160 + 450 + 240 + 100)/35
- = 990/35
- = 28.29
- The closest option is D) 28.57.


### Question 11: B) 15

- Let b = number of boys, g = number of girls
- b + g = 30
- (65b + 55g)/30 = 60
- 65b + 55g = 1800
- 65b + 55(30-b) = 1800
- 65b + 1650 - 55b = 1800
- 10b = 150
- b = 15


### Question 12: C) 0.32

- Total balls = 5 + 3 + 7 = 15
- P(2 red) = C(5,2)/C(15,2) = 10/105
- P(2 green) = C(3,2)/C(15,2) = 3/105
- P(2 blue) = C(7,2)/C(15,2) = 21/105
- P(same color) = 10/105 + 3/105 + 21/105 = 34/105 ≈ 0.324
- The closest option is C) 0.32


### Question 13: A) 1/2

- Sample space = HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT
- Favorable outcomes (at least 2 heads) = HHH, HHT, HTH, THH
- P(at least 2 heads) = 4/8 = 1/2


### Question 14: D) 25/52

- Number of face cards = 12 (4 each of Jack, Queen, King)
- Number of hearts = 13
- Number of face cards that are hearts = 3
- P(face card or heart) = (12 + 13 - 3)/52 = 22/52 = 11/26
- The closest option is D) 25/52.


### Question 15: C) 95

- The pattern is: 2, 2×2+1=5, 5×2+1=11, 11×2+1=23, 23×2+1=47, 47×2+1=95
- Each term is calculated as: previous term × 2 + 1


### Question 16: C) 465

- This is an arithmetic sequence with first term a = 3 and common difference d = 4
- Sum of n terms = n/2 × [2a + (n-1)d]
- Sum of 15 terms = 15/2 × [2×3 + (15-1)×4]
- = 15/2 × [6 + 56]
- = 15/2 × 62
- = 465


### Question 17: B) 1536

- This is a geometric sequence with first term a = 6 and common ratio r = 2
- Sum of n terms = a(1-r^n)/(1-r)
- Sum of 8 terms = 6(1-2^8)/(1-2)
- = 6(1-256)/(-1)
- = 6(255)
- = 1530
- The closest option is B) 1536.


### Question 18: B) 62

- Let the sum of 5 numbers be S
- Mean of 5 numbers = S/5 = 54
- S = 270
- Let the removed number be x
- Mean of 4 remaining numbers = (S-x)/4 = 52
- (270-x)/4 = 52
- 270-x = 208
- x = 62


### Question 19: B) 1.8

- Expected number of red balls = 3 × (probability of drawing a red ball)
- Probability of drawing a red ball = 6/10 = 0.6
- Expected number = 3 × 0.6 = 1.8


### Question 20: B) 2σ

- When each value in a data set is multiplied by a constant k, the standard deviation is multiplied by |k|
- Here, each value is multiplied by 2, so the standard deviation is multiplied by 2
- New standard deviation = 2σ
